# Matrix Operations Class

## Problem Description
This program defines a C++ class (`Array2d`) to represent and manipulate 2D matrices. It includes methods for getting/setting elements, resizing the matrix, retrieving rows, finding the row with the maximum sum, and overloading the addition operator (`+`) for matrix addition.

## Solution Approach

### Algorithm
Implements a 2D matrix class with various operations.

### Key Insights
- Uses 2D array or vector to store matrix elements
- Provides methods for element access, resizing, and operations
- Overloads operators for intuitive matrix operations

### Implementation Details
- Class-based design for encapsulation
- Methods for get/set, resize, row operations
- Operator overloading for matrix addition

### Time Complexity
Varies by operation: O(1) for access, O(n*m) for operations

### Space Complexity
O(n*m) for n×m matrix

## Code
See the `.cpp` file in this directory for the complete solution.
