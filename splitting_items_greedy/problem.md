# Splitting Items Greedy

## Problem Statement
This program implements a solution likely related to a resource allocation or item distribution problem. Based on the code structure, it seems to involve sorting items and distributing them between two parties (Alice and Bob) following a specific logic, potentially involving a greedy approach and a modification factor `k`. The goal appears to be calculating the difference in the total value of items received by each party.
