# Reachable Coordinates

## Problem Description
This program simulates movement on a grid based on a given sequence of directions (North, South, East, West). It determines if a target coordinate (a, b) is reached within a certain number of steps, following a repeating route pattern. This problem involves basic coordinate tracking and loop control.
